# KrishiVue - AI-powered Plant and Disease Detection

## Description

KrishiVue is a mobile application designed for plant leaf detection and disease classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The application assists farmers in identifying crop diseases efficiently through real-time camera feeds and image uploads. The backend is powered by **FastAPI**, ensuring fast and scalable API development, while the mobile application is developed using **Flutter** for cross-platform compatibility.

## Features

- **Real-time plant disease detection** using camera feeds.
- **Image upload support** for disease classification.
- **Pre-trained models** like **SSD MobileNetV2** and **ResNet** for high accuracy.
- **Detailed disease diagnosis** to help farmers make informed decisions.
